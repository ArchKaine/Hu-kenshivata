Clarification on Yota (Friend) and Help:

While "Yota-wali" (friend-speak) can be used for situations where a friend helps through communication, the core meaning of "Yota" (friend) can be expanded through context or additional words to encompass various ways friends help each other, including non-verbal actions.

Here are some examples:

    Yota chi lo shira shena (Friend do/act toward arrive) - A friend helped me arrive. (Context clarifies the action)
    Yota wina-kenshi (Friend see/observe-understand) - A friend who understands through seeing/observing. (Suggests emotional support)
    Yota duva-ki hu lo wisha shena (Friend lack-with human-air knowledge give) - A friend helped me by giving me something to breathe (assuming the friend provided air in a dangerous situation).

This approach maintains the core meaning of "Yota" (friend)  while using context, additional details, or existing vocabulary to express the specific ways friends help each other.
